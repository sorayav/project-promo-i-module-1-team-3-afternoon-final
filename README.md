# Welcome to Collapsing Margings website! # 


:bulb: This project is part of [Adalab](https://adalab.es) curriculum. The goal was to create a responsive website with information about our team and ourselves individually, according to the client needs, and it features a main page and a second page with a functional contact form.

## Tech used

:atom_symbol: The first prototype of the website was done using HTLM5 and CSS3. Following Agile & SCRUM workflow and using Trello app to organize our tasks, during the second sprint we had to re-do the website by using Gulp to automatize and SASS (SCSS) to style.

## The website

#### Header

A header with three different menus that will take you to each of the sections

#### Hero

An image that represents us and our motto!

#### About us

#### Strengths and Weaknesses 

Our strengths and weaknesses as a team, what we can contribute and what we need.

#### Adalabers cards

#### Footer

#### Form
