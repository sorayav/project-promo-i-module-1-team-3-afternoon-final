# Welcome to Collapsing Margings website! # 


:bulb: This project is part of [Adalab](https://adalab.es) curriculum. The goal was to create a responsive website with information about our team and ourselves individually, according to the client needs, and it features a main page and a second page with a functional contact form.

## Tech used

:atom_symbol: The first prototype of the website was done using HTLM5 and CSS3. Following Agile & SCRUM workflow and using the Trello app to organize our tasks, during the second sprint we had to re-do the website by using Gulp to automatize and SASS (SCSS) to style.

## The website

:speech_balloon: The **structure** of the website is as follows:

#### Header

A header with three different menus that will take you to each section.

#### Hero

An image that represents us and our motto!

#### About us

Information on how we work as a team.

#### Strengths and weaknesses 

Our strengths and weaknesses as a team, what we can contribute and what we need.

#### Adalabers cards

Information about each one of us so you can get to know us better.

#### Footer
	
Our logo and 3 different links to surf through the website.

#### Contact form
A contact form with obligatory fields to fill, with the option to return to the main page and navigate to the sections of the web.
